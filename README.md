🛡️ Splunk SOC Dashboards – Security Monitoring & Threat Detection
📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of Security Operations Center (SOC) dashboards using Splunk Enterprise 10.0.2.
The dashboards provide real-time visibility into security events, helping analysts detect suspicious behavior, investigate incidents, and make informed decisions quickly.

The project focuses on log ingestion, correlation, visualization, and threat detection across multiple data sources commonly used in SOC environments.

🎯 Objectives

Build SOC-ready dashboards for security monitoring

Detect suspicious activities such as brute-force attacks and abnormal web traffic

Visualize security metrics for faster incident triage

Apply Splunk SPL queries for security analytics
